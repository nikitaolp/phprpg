 * entityIdArray format:
 * 
 * each array element represents either a tile id (starts with 1), or array of [tile id, entity id]
 * 
 * entities starting with 2 are mobs, with 3 are items, with 4 are players, but i don't think i will use 4
 * 
 * entities starting with 9 will be "special", so far i plan to use 999 as a player spawn point
